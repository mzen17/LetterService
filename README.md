# Letter Service
- Estimated Time: 1-3 hours ~2 hours
- Total Time: 3 hours

## Testing/Usage
Drop admission-8digitID.txt or scholarship-8digitID.txt into the input folder under their role [Admission or Scholarship], under a date folder [E.g, 20220125], as specified in description. An example is provided, please change this to the files that you need.

You may want to create the Output or Archive files; not doing this probably won't cause any problems but just in case.

# Misc
- Bundled the other functions (archive and text report) as part of LetterService class as it is reasonable to think that it should handle every part of the pipeline consisting of letters.
